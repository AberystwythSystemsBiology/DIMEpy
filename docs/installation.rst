Installation
============

DIMEpy requires Python 3+ and is unfortunately not compatible with Python 2. If you are still using Python 2, a clever workaround is to install Python 3 and use that instead.

You can install it through pypi using ``pip``::

pip install dimepy

If you want the 'bleeding edge' version this, you can also install directly from this repository using ``git`` - but beware of dragons::

pip install git+https://www.github.com/AberystwythSystemsBiology/DIMEpy
